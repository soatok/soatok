# Hi, I'm Soatok!

![OwO what's this?](stickers/SoatokTelegrams2020-06.png)

I'm a [gay](https://soatok.blog/2020/06/09/pridemonth/)
furry computer programmer with a [dhole fursona](https://soatok.blog/2020/08/10/all-about-dholes-and-dhole-fursonas/).

Everything I publish on this Github account is strictly for fun,
and usually intended to benefit the furry and LGBTQIA+ communities.

I write a lot about the furry fandom, computer security, and 
cryptography on my blog, [*Dhole Moments*](https://soatok.blog).
